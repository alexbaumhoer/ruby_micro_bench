# Ruby Micro-benchmarks

Compare like-behavior methods to determine the fastest method

## Goals

* Uses assertions at the end to ensure exact same behavior
* attempt to test for GC/object cost
* attempt to test for input/value variation
* use IPS, BigO, make pretty graphs
* Try to make collaborative
* Try on various ruby platforms to compare (travis!)
* add test for like-behavior from gems (activesupport, etc)
